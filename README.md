## Data Visualization POWER BI

These visualizations correspond to the results of the analysis of a systematic review on emotion recognition models based on electrodermal activity.

Here is the PDF version of a series of interactive visualizations. Data transformation and cleaning was carried out with Power Query.

This version does not constitute the final version of the project. It is being updated day by day.

New sheets and dimensions are expected to be added to visualizations.


## Data

A shared database was created among the researchers, where each paper was classified according to the following criteria: metadata (data on authors, title, year of publication, journal where it was published, type of article, country of affiliation of first author); type of data (original or from database, if the latter, specify which); participants (relevant characteristics of the sample: size, gender, age range, country of origin, etc.); affective stimulation technique (type of affective stimulus used, exposure time); self report (if used, what type used, emotion model used); EDA (equipment used, location of sensors); statistical learning models (output of model used, type of model); emotion model and performance of emotion recognition models with EDA.
